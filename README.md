# weather_forcast
This project is to showcase the open weather api five days forecast capabilities with volley and MVVM architecture.  Will be updating the project with picasso image instead of normal image loading in near future.
Data binding and model are the two things showcased along with the weather api.
This project currently supports portrait model.  Also there will be a crash if you don't connect gps or network while starting the app.  Bugs will be fixed in next release.
